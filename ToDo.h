First First:

	Change the word mutation method into an evo algorithm   ..DONE

First:


	Analyze the checkpoint fitness function with different configurations of the checkpoints to see the effect of the fitness function  ..DONE

Second:

	Then find the best parameters of the two methods by parameter tuning

Third:

	Compare the two methods with their best parameters

At some point:

	Write the experimental proposal
		* Write draft for checkpoint analysis ..DONE
		* Write draft for fine\ tuning
		* Write draft for comparing

// need to set up the mutation parameters    ..DONE
// finish setting everything up (set up LOG)
// then look for research
// then write everything up
// write outline whats done and what needs to be done
// + schedule

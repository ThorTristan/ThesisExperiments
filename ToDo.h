		For containt matrix and checkpoint analysis:
			neeed to store the individuals somewhere so i can look at them.



		Need a way to view the mazes


		And need to fix the ff2 













First First:

	Change the word mutation method into an evo algorithm   ..DONE

First:


	Analyze the checkpoint fitness function with different configurations of the checkpoints to see the effect of the fitness function  ..DONE

Second:

	Then find the best parameters of the two methods by parameter tuning

Third:

	Compare the two methods with their best parameters

At some point:

	Write the experimental proposal
		* Write draft for checkpoint analysis ..DONE
		* Write draft for fine tuning  ..DONE
		* Write draft for comparing  ..DONE

/*


// need to set up the mutation parameters    ..DONE
// finish setting everything up (set up LOG)  ..DONE
// then look for research ..Done
// then write everything up  ..DONE
// write outline whats done and what needs to be done  ..DONE
// + schedule  ..DONE


// Wednesday:
   * add the constraint matrix and play with fitness function
   * change the selection stuff from the evo algorithms   ...DONE
   * add the checkpoint patterns  ..DONE
   * make sure everything works
   * do more research.
   * look at the google docs i have

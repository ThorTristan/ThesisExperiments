First First:

	Change the word mutation method into an evo algorithm   ..DONE

First:


	Analyze the checkpoint fitness function with different configurations of the checkpoints to see the effect of the fitness function  ..DONE

Second:

	Then find the best parameters of the two methods by parameter tuning

Third:

	Compare the two methods with their best parameters

At some point:

	Write the experimental proposal
